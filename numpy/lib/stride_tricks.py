    Create a view into the array with the given shape and strides.

    .. warning:: This function has to be used with extreme care, see notes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray
        Array to create a new.
    shape : sequence of int, optional
        The shape of the new array. Defaults to ``x.shape``.
    strides : sequence of int, optional
        The strides of the new array. Defaults to ``x.strides``.
    subok : bool, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.10

        If True, subclasses are preserved.
    writeable : bool, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.12

        If set to False, the returned array will always be readonly.
        Otherwise it will be writable if the original array was. It
        is advisable to set this to False if possible (see Notes).

    Returns
    -------
    view : ndarray

    See also
    --------
    broadcast_to: broadcast an array to a given shape.
    reshape : reshape an array.

    Notes
    -----
    ``as_strided`` creates a view into the array given the exact strides
    and shape. This means it manipulates the internal data structure of
    ndarray and, if done incorrectly, the array elements can point to
    invalid memory and can corrupt results or crash your program.
    It is advisable to always use the original ``x.strides`` when
    calculating new strides to avoid reliance on a contiguous memory
    layout.

    Furthermore, arrays created with this function often contain self
    overlapping memory, so that two elements are identical.
    Vectorized write operations on such arrays will typically be
    unpredictable. They may even give different results for small, large,
    or transposed arrays.
    Since writing to these arrays has to be tested and done with great
    care, you may want to use ``writeable=False`` to avoid accidental write
    operations.

    For these reasons it is advisable to avoid ``as_strided`` when
    possible.

    Create sliding window views of the N dimensions array with the given window
    shape. Window slides across each dimension of `x` and extract subsets of `x`
    at any window position.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray
        Array to create sliding window views.

    shape : sequence of int
        The shape of the window. Must have same length as number of input array dimensions.

    step: sequence of int, optional
        The steps of window shifts for each dimension on input array at a time.
        If given, must have same length as number of input array dimensions.

    subok : bool, optional
        If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through, otherwise the returned

    writeable : bool, optional
        If set to False, the returned array will always be readonly view.
        Otherwise it will return writable copies(see Notes).

    Returns
    -------
    view : ndarray
        Sliding window views (or copies) of `x`. view.shape = (x.shape - shape) // step + 1

    See also
    --------
    as_strided: Create a view into the array with the given shape and strides.
    broadcast_to: broadcast an array to a given shape.

    Notes
    -----
    ``sliding_window_view`` create sliding window views of the N dimensions array
    with the given window shape and its implementation based on ``as_strided``.
    Please note that if writeable set to False, the return is views, not copies
    of array. In this case, write operations could be unpredictable, so the return
    views is readonly. Bear in mind, return copies (writeable=True), could possibly
    take memory multiple amount of origin array, due to overlapping windows.

    For these reasons it is advisable to use ``writeable=False``. Otherwise,
    multiple write operations shall be avoided. For more warning details,
    see Notes from ``as_strided``.

    For some cases, there may be more efficient approaches, such as FFT based algo discussed in #7753.
